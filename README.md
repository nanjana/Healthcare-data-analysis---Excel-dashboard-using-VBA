# Healthcare-data-analysis---Excel-dashboard-using-VBA
# Excel VBA Healthcare Dashboard

## Overview

This project is an Excel-based interactive dashboard for healthcare data analysis, built using **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**. The dashboard automates the creation of multiple pivot tables and visualizes data with charts, enabling users to quickly and easily analyze healthcare data.

The dashboard covers a variety of key metrics such as patient gender vs. medical conditions, admission dates vs. hospitals, billing amounts, test results, and more. It allows users to interact with the data using slicers and dynamically updated charts.

## Features

- **Automated Pivot Table Creation**: VBA code automatically creates multiple pivot tables based on healthcare data and places them on separate sheets.
- **Customizable Charts**: Different chart types (e.g., line charts, bar charts, pie charts) are generated to provide visual insights into the data.
- **Slicer Integration**: A slicer is available to filter data across multiple pivot tables, allowing users to focus on specific areas of interest.
- **Dynamic Refreshing**: Pivot tables and charts can be refreshed automatically with the click of a button to ensure the latest data is always displayed.
